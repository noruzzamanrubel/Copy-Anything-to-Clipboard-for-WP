"Copy to Clipboard" is a feature that allows users to copy content from a website or application and save it to their computer's clipboard.

== Description ==
"Copy to Clipboard" is a feature that allows users to easily copy content from a website or application and paste it elsewhere. It is a commonly used tool that provides convenience and efficiency in tasks such as sharing content, taking notes, or saving important information.

The process of copying to clipboard involves selecting the desired content, which could be text, images, or other media, and using a keyboard shortcut or right-clicking and selecting "Copy" from a context menu. The content is then temporarily stored in a virtual clipboard, which allows the user to paste it into another application or document.

This feature has become an integral part of modern computing and is supported by most operating systems and applications. It has evolved over the years to include additional functionalities, such as the ability to copy and paste multiple items or to access a history of copied items.

One of the main advantages of the "Copy to Clipboard" feature is its ability to facilitate the sharing of information across different platforms and applications. Users can easily copy content from one application and paste it into another, without having to manually retype the information. This saves time and reduces the risk of errors.
